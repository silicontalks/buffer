# PYNQ FPGA board

PYNQ is a python based zynq7020 board that run a python system locally. 
It support many operations in instruction level, but also allows programmable logic by bit file.
Many examples demonstrates the board efficiency on [PYNQ.io](https://pnyq.io) by high level synthesis.

However, the **BUFFER** project provides a verilog/system-verilog level design with the PYNQ board.
